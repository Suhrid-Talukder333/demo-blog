<p>To use all the functionality of this project, local storage access is needed. A demo blog website made with React, Redux. I used Json placeholder api to get premade data and store those data in local storage for modification and doing CRUD functionality. You can create new accounts, create posts, read posts, update your own posts, delete your posts. All these functionality changes the data in the local storage.</p>
